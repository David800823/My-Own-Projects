Hi all,

Here is my US economic Data.
In this folder, you will find some files. 
1) CPI_all_values.csv - is a CSV from the Python script
2) Inflation_Analysis.ipynb - is a jupyter notebook that contains a script retrieving data from the Federal Reserve Economic Dataset.

Please feel free to look at my tableau public.

I created some visuals from the data I web-scraped.
