Hi all,

Here is my US economic Data.
In this folder, you will find some files. 
1) CPI_all_values.csv - is a CSV from the Python script
2) Inflation_Analysis.ipynb - is a jupyter notebook that contains a script retrieving data from the Federal Reserve Economic Dataset.
3) Economic_Analysis_of_the_USA - this file was a school project. It is me retrieving data from FRED and create charts. 
4) Fight_Against_Inflation - this file I use Plotly to visualize the 1,3,6,9, and 12 month CPI Change. More edits to come.

Please feel free to look at my tableau public.

I created some visuals from the data I web-scraped.
